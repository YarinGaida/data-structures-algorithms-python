# ðŸ“š Stack Implementations in Python

This folder contains two implementations of the **Stack** data structure:

1. **Educational Example (Functions)** â€“ A minimal version to demonstrate the core logic of stack operations.  
2. **Practical Example (Class)** â€“ A more structured version using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), closer to real-world usage.

## ðŸ§© What is a Stack?
A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle.  
- **Push** â†’ Add an element to the top.  
- **Pop** â†’ Remove the top element.  
- **Peek** â†’ Look at the top element without removing it.  
- **is_empty / size** â†’ Utility methods for management.
