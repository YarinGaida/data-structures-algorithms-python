# Data Structures & Algorithms 📚

This repository contains implementations of classic data structures and algorithms in Python.  
Each implementation is documented with **time complexity, space complexity, and example usage**.  
The goal is to provide a clear reference for learning, practice, and interview preparation.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `sorting/` – sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort, QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.)  
- `searching/` – searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)  
- `data_structures/` – linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, hash tables  
- `graphs/` – graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)  
- `dynamic_programming/` – common DP problems and solutions  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Strengthen understanding of algorithmic fundamentals  
- Practice clean coding with clear documentation  
- Provide a personal reference for technical interviews and coursework  

---

## 🛠️ Conventions
- Each algorithm is implemented in Python (`.py` file)  
- Each folder contains a `README.md` describing:  
  - The algorithm/structure in words  
  - Time and space complexity  
  - Example code snippet  
- Code files include inline comments for clarity and complexity notes
